 Advanced bots with route finding capabilities and waypoint support. Entirely customisable!
 !loadlayout allows loading of a new layout without a restart

 Wallcrawl
 Use waypoints to navigate the map and go to a location without getting stuck
 Effectively dodge.
 Will not keep human players from spawning
 Anti-Hax-type aiming using recoil system depending on skill level
}

==Bot edits by me==
-Goon pounces TO human, not ABOVE human. (pitch was *10, now *6)
-Lcannon charges 2.7 mseconds instead of original 2 because my luci charge takes 2.8 seconds
-now buys troll weapons [see below] with an exception of basi-suit

From Lolards v0.7 qvm by ZdrytchX [a.k.a. ULTRA Random ViruS , please keep this a secret :D]:

'Balance' mod - changed variables and stuff:
==MAIN POINTS== [not all listed here]
-Blaster/Energy Pistol - Haz Ammo although stronger //I terminated this because blaster doesn't spanw with ammo
-Shotgun - 'Spray of defeat' - now changed to "reversed pump shotgun" because it is a faster shoot, more accurate and faster reload time but also weaker (previous 108 dmg, now ~70-80 dmg per shot)
-Plasma rifle is explosive and bounces off walls
-faster chaingun
-More realistic Flame Thrower (faster repeat, weaker)
-GPP-like Lucifercannon, but has a stronger, slower secondary fire. Use primary fire to deal with dretches.
-Mass Driver is more like a sniper rifle, but weaker than the first version [where you shoot 138 dmg, 3 second cooldown] to something more over-powerful, 72 dmg with a 1.25 second cooldown. I also increased reload time to 4 seconds.

-Granger Barb now bounces
-AdvDragoon now bombs, and use inertia to propell the bomb forward but in return, you only have one snipe
-Most human 'slow' weapons use inertia
-Humans have a lower probability of death, but have a higher damage input when falling froma  great hight (height for Americans =P)
-AdvGranger falls to gravity

-max evos = 13, max creds = 3000
-every alien class has its own cost:
	CLASS		COST [evos]	

	granger		free
	adv granger	free
	dretch		free
	basi		1
	adv basi	3
	Mar		2
	Adv Mar		5 (effective but useless zap)
	Goon		4 (kill whore problem)
	adv goon	6 (bombs)
	rant		7 (TAAAAAAANK!)
	basi-suit	9 [adv goon and tyrant are considered upgrades, so if ur a rant, its 4 evos left. (Wait, what about the advance marauder?!? I don't know.)]

-Chainturrets [a.k.a. turrets with faster fireing rate]have longer range but heavily rely on DCC for turning
    -- hidden weapon, with 600 bullet rounds, but its a weak gun so not recommended. It costs 600.
-Teslas - same knockback although tyrants move slightly.
-RC - still hop-able but more harder to kill because zap is slightly stronger and repeats faster
-OM - Harder to saw, impossible to saw without any armour
-Cades - useful now as they have 800 hp (planning on 600, but that requires two luci shots only, i think this isnt enough)
-Boost - longer lasting poison in alien and damage dealt to humans as well as poison lasting in humans
-Trapper - kills with a 'should've died somehow' message and is also deadly
    --hidden weapon for humans as well, i would like to troll people by if they give a human bot 3000 creds, and they go to an armoury with armour already on them, they buy a lockblob launcher [a.k.a. trapper tool] but onlt traps humans sadly :( - i'm working on this. It has 12 explosive barbs in 10 clips.
-Hives - deadly
    --Let's troll some humans by buying these! (cost 2000 creds though to stop spamming)


-Grenade costs 600, but its like a mini-nuke.

-Added blips for alien scanner for viewing aliens [green = friend, yellow = buildable]

-Added 'Vampire' mode to the game overall
   -Get 50% of damage done to enemy + a bit if you are human; if not, it is done porpotionally.
   -Max health [temporarily] is 150% of max regeneration
   -Fixed/hacked 'invincable ressurection' but still has a glitch where you still can turn your camera and look around, and ur HUD stays there :(
   -Buildables now also heal themselves - convinance for humies! (but another problem - aliens can take health from buildables.)
   -Humans don't lose extra health [for now. I gotta fix this... :(]

-Custom Death messages!

-GPP features such as knockback in pounce, 3-pounce kill and a charge that can easily kill a unarmoured human in one shot (and possibly another if he continues to kill without stopping).
-DRAIN LIFE ENERGY type zap, its slow but powerful! They also stack so you can do max damage on multiple targets! I'm still working on a zap which doesn't need to be aimed, but i need the KoRx source code to see what they've done first.

-ADDED HIDDEN CLASS [aliens] - Basi-Suit - a wasted human class so i added it to aliens with a basilisk weapon
   - bsuit boundry box allignend with model [can't do this with normal bsuit :(]
   - walljumper and can use ladders!
   - slow healer, rely on booster

-Medikit [or medkit] now has 30 second immunity to poison
   -also heals an extra 80%
   -can be bought at armoury - KoRx gave me this idea

-Sudden Death now allows you to build a one of each:
	repeater
	dcc
	armoury
	medistat (not needed though, but its for noobs who don't know about medikit from armoury)

-Jetpack - Not a hot-air balloon! =P

-Water - Deadly, but starts of weaker

/// And shitloads moar! \\\
